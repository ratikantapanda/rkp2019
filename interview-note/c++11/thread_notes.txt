q1- When two thread access a code at the same time , what happen?How it prevented?
Ans:- data race condition, impact- value of the varibale may be unprdictable
      Prevention- use thread synchronization techniqueue like - mutex(lock) or semaphor.
	It ensure that two or more concurrent programs or threads do not simulteneously execute same
	program segment.
q2- Mutex vs Semaphore ?
 Ans:- Mutex is locking mechanism.It lock a shared resource.
       Semaphore is signaling mechanism.Semaphore control access to shared resources  through the use of counter.
       If counter is greater than zero , the access is allowed and if it is zero , then access is denied.
       Binary semaphore(0,1) are used like mutex.
